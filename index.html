	    <p class="modal_text">Welcome,<br><br> The goal of this personal project was to visualize my own phone use behavior. I tracked my own phone data for 4 weeks. Each flash of the gif represents an individual instance of me picking up my phone (Picking up the phone and atleast turning on the home screen). The picture that flashes on the screen represents the app I was using. The number of times an app flashes is proportional to how much time I spent using that app. I ordered the apps to flash from least to most used. Lastly the total number of flashes is equal to the average number of times I picked up my phone.   <br><br> Hover/Tap over the image to Begin! (It may take a second to start, stay hovering over the image untill it finishes)</p>
